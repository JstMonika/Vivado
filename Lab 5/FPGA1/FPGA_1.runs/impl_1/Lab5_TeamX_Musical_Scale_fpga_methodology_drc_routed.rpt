There is a large setup violation of -69.440 ns between BEAT_FREQ_reg[1]_replica_3/C (clocked by sys_clk_pin) and beatSpeed/count_reg[27]/D (clocked by sys_clk_pin). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>
